# TipCalculatorProject
# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator* is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Kevin Orellana**

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Allow the user to specify a custom tip percentage.
- [x] Allow the user to specify whether or not the program must remember the custom tip percentage entered.
- [x] Allow the user to split the bill amount between multiple people.

## Notes

The biggest challenge for this project was figuring out how view controllers can pass data to each other. After doing some research, I accomplished this by using protocols.
Additionally, I had a hard time specifying the correct constrains for all my objects in the app. In spite of these challenges, I thoroughly enjoyed completing this project and I am excited to what is to come.
